Step 1 : Go to Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) 

Step2 : Upload the Source Code of Deep Neural Network notebook to Google colab

Step 3 : Start training of model by clicking on play button in top left. It will take about 1.5
hours to complete 10 epochs and trained model will automatically downloaded (for 
convenience trained model is already provided)

Step 4 : Install Anaconda

Step 5 : Go to anaconda prompt and create a python enivornment of python version
greater than 3.6 by running following command : conda create --name myenv python=3.7

Step 6 : Activate your environment by running following command : conda activate myenv

Step 7 : Install following packages : Tensorflow, Keras, socket-io, eventlet, flask, opencv
           Use command : conda install package_name

Step 8 : Run the flask app by using command : python flaskApp_file

Step 9 : Install Udacity simulator 

Step 10 : Select a track and click on "Autonomous Mode"
